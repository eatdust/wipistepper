# Wipistepper: high level controls for serious steppers

---

Wipistepper provides two python modules, **wipidrive** and
**wipimotor** providing high level functions built on top of
*wiringpi* to control stepper motors and their drivers connected to a
Raspberry Pi.

Please ensure that you have a working installation of
[wiringpi](http://wiringpi.com/) as well as its python wrappers [WiringPi-Python](https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi-Python)
